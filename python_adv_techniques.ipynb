This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",

    "  - Although the protected variable can be accessed out of the class as well as in the derived class(modified too in derived class), it is customary(convention not a rule) to not access the protected out the class body.\n",
    "  - Private members are similar to protected members, the difference is that the class members declared private should neither be accessed outside the class nor by any base class. In Python, there is no existence of Private instance variables that cannot be accessed except inside a class.\n",
